# Netrex
 A software for MinecraftPE written in TypeScript
 
## Overview
Originally I was planning on completing Bedrock.js but due to some of the core's architecture I decided to work on this instead. This was heavily inspired by BedrockJS. This project is purely for "fun" and for "learning" raknet and level implementation.

## Installation
**1.)** Clone this repository into a folder.<br />
**2.)** Run `start.cmd` or `start.sh`<br />
**3.)** Enjoy development?

### Features
